Repair the digital climate control (DCC) mounting tabs for your Mitsubishi 3000GT/GTO or Dodge Stealth permanently with these repair pieces.

Holes are included in the design for 6#-32 countersunk PC screws, which allow for a structural anchor to the housing, while the adhesive serves to prevent any subtle rotation.

If you do not have the means to print or install these yourself, we offer installation as part of our (DCC Rebuild Service)[https://3shub.com/store/services/electronics/dcc-rebuild/] at 3000GT/Stealth Hub. 

### Recommended Print Settings

I use a Prusa MK3S+ with a 0.4mm nozzle on the minimum supported layer height with 100% infill.

For the other side tab, simply mirror the one provided in your slicer.

A minimum of PETG is recommended to minimize the chance of heat warping when installed in summer interior temperatures. If you live in a very hot climate, consider ABS or PC.

### Installation Requirements

The 6#-32 screws are [commonly available in black](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B01MSKQ1HH), [a properly sized drill bit and tap are recommended](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B0006V6MNW). The screws can be omitted and the holes filled with the adhesive of your choice should you prefer. 

(Black plastic bonder)[https://www.amazon.ca/Weld-50139-Plastic-Adhesive-Syringe/dp/B01IBOK7FE] is also highly recommended, although any temperature-safe adhesive can be used as the primary anchor. 

If you are missing any screw clips, they can be ordered [from AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005230970314.html), or in a [kit from Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07Z17SHQB/).

### Installation Procedure

1. Disassemble the housing, being mindful not to lose any of the gold screws or white plastic key pins. While it is disassembled, it's a good time to change the capacitors on the control board - [if you don't feel comfortable doing this, we offer it as part of our rebuild service](https://3shub.com/store/services/electronics/dcc-rebuild/).
2. Using a dremel with a cut-off wheel (or a hacksaw if that's what you've got), remove the areas of remaining damaged tab to allow for the repair piece to line up perfectly with the ridges on the housing. Ensure the tab repair piece fits flush to the housing.
3. Mark the housing where the screw hole(s) are in the repair pieces, drill the hole(s) and run the tap through the hole(s).
4. Apply plastic bonder or your adhesive of choice to all contact surfaces of the tab repair as well as the threads of the screw hole, being mindful not to get any in unintended places.
5. Mount the tab and tighten the screws, being mindful not to strip the threads (they are plastic afterall). If you're worried about side tabs not lining up perfectly, you can use a gentle grip with a pair of vise grips or similar tool to hold it in line with the vertical fin.
6. Allow the adhesive to fully cure before removing any vise grips or moving the housing.
7. Reassemble the climate control assembly.
